    <h1>Welding</h1></div>
    <div id="para"><h2>
        Welding is a process of joining similar metals by application of heat with or without application of pressure and addition of filler material. The result is a continuity of homogeneous material, of the composition and characteristics of two parts which are being joined together. The application of welding is so varied and extensive that it would be no exaggeration to say that there is no metal industry and no branch of engineering that doesn't make use of welding in one form or another.

        <h3>Bench-Wise</h3><h4>The vice essentially consists of cast iron body, a fixed jaw, a movable joint all made of cast steel, a handle, a square-threaded screw, and a nut all made of mild steel. Separate cast steel plates known as jaw plates are fixed to the joitns by means of set screws and they can be replaced when worn. The holding places of the join plates have teeth for holding the work firmly. The movement of the vice is caused by the movement the screw through the nut fixed under the movable jaw and the screw is provided with a collar inside it to prevent it coming out of the jaw when resolved.
